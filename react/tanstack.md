## ♥️ TanStack Query

### `QueryClient`

The central manager in TanStack Query:
* Holds cache of all queries.
* Provides API to fetch, refetch, remove queries.
* Keeps configuration for retries, garbage collection, defaults.

### Prefetch, hydration, and `HydrationBoundary`

React Query hydration means synchronizing server-fetched data into client's cache.

`HydrationBoundary` is a **client** component that makes that cache available to client so useQuery doesn’t refetch unnecessarily.

### Core objects and types

* **Column Defs**: Objects used to configure a column and its data model, display templates, and more.
    
    * **Accessor columns** have underlying model -> can be sorted, filtered, grouped, etc.
    * **Display columns** don't have a data model -> cannot be sorted, filtered, grouped, etc.
    * **Grouping columns** don't have a data model -> cannot be sorted, filtered, grouped, etc.

* **Table**: The core table object containing both state and API.

* **Table Data**: The core data array you provide the table.

* **Columns**: Each column mirrors its respective column def and also provides column-specific APIs.

* **Rows**: Each row mirrors its respective row data and provides row-specific APIs.

* **Header Groups**: Header groups are computed slices of nested header levels, each containing a group of headers.

* **Headers**: Each header is either directly associated with or derived from its column def and provides header-specific APIs.

* **Cells**: Each cell mirrors its respective row-column intersection and provides cell-specific APIs.

TanStack Table comes with many features, each with their own associated options and API:
* Column Ordering
* Column Pinning
* Column Sizing
* Column Visibility
* Expanding
* Column Faceting
* Column Filtering
* Global Faceting
* Global Filtering
